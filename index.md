## 📂 Projects

### 📦 Project 1 — Predictive Analytics for Delivery Delay Reduction (Supply Chain)

**Goal:** Reduce late deliveries for an e-commerce company (DataCo Global) by predicting whether an order will be **on-time or late**.

**What I did:**
- Cleaned and prepared a large supply chain dataset (180k+ rows, 50+ features).
- Performed EDA, correlation analysis, and visualized top product categories with late deliveries.
- Built classification models using **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** in Python.
- Evaluated model performance and identified signs of overfitting, suggesting further regularization and model tuning.
- Translated results into **business recommendations** (optimize shipment modes, inventory strategy, and ERP alerts) to improve on-time delivery and customer satisfaction.

**Tech:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter

### 💳 Project 2 — Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

**Goal:** Detect fraudulent transactions from a large historical dataset and compare multiple machine learning models for fraud classification.

**What I did:**
- Explored a dataset of **600k+ financial transactions** with features like transaction type, balances, and fraud flags.
- Performed preprocessing (type mapping, dimension reduction via correlation matrix) and examined **class imbalance** in fraud labels.
- Trained and evaluated multiple models: **KNN, Logistic Regression, CART (Decision Trees), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost**.
- Used metrics such as **accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve** to compare models.
- Discovered that several models showed unrealistically high accuracy due to overfitting and imbalance; selected **Logistic Regression** as the most stable baseline model and outlined next steps (resampling, threshold tuning).

**Tech:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Jupyter
